She is not only beautiful but also the bravest woman I'd ever known. She loves her children so much to the point that she would sacrifice herself for them. My mom is a superhero not only because she can do simultaneous task in the house, but because she can turn our sadness to happiness in an instant! My momy is very humble and forgiving. She forgives others easily and comforts them as well. What makes her the best mom is that you can trust her with anything. </p>

                            <p>Azriel is the Math wizard of the family. Despite his young age, he already thinks critically, something that you wouldn't think of when you were at his age. He is really smart and a genius. He competes in playing chess, and in math as well. He think of jokes and riddles that will really trick your mind and will make you use your brain. But what I love about him is not only of his geekiness, but because of his sweet and loving character! He smiles and laughs easily causing you laugh hard too. He is very sweet and clingy to the person he loves. He is a forgiving person and a very pure-hearted one. Staying mad at him is too difficult. So adorable! </p>
